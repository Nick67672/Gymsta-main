# Smart Rest Timer Migration Guide

## Database Migration Required

To enable the new smart rest timer features, you need to run the database migration:

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This will create the following new tables:
- `user_rest_preferences` - Store user's preferred rest times per exercise
- `rest_time_analytics` - Track actual vs suggested rest times for learning
- `user_workout_preferences` - Global user workout preferences

## New Features Added

### 1. **Smart Rest Timer Hook** (`hooks/useSmartRestTimer.ts`)
- Adaptive rest time calculation based on user history
- Exercise-type specific suggestions
- Fatigue adjustment based on workout progress
- Analytics tracking for continuous learning

### 2. **Enhanced Timer Component** (`components/SmartRestTimer.tsx`)
- Inline smart suggestions with confidence scores
- Gesture controls for quick time adjustments
- Contextual rest recommendations
- Compact mode for minimal UI
- Progress visualization with animations

### 3. **Analytics Dashboard** (`components/RestAnalytics.tsx`)
- Rest time consistency tracking
- Performance correlation analysis
- Exercise-specific breakdowns
- Personalized insights and recommendations
- Trend visualization

### 4. **Updated Workout Session**
- Integrated smart timer instead of basic modal
- Automatic context detection (compound movements, etc.)
- Real-time workout progress tracking

## Key Improvements

1. **Intelligent Suggestions**: Timer learns from your behavior and suggests optimal rest times
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Considers exercise type, set number, and workout progress
3. **Seamless UX**: No more modals - everything is inline and intuitive
